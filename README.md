# Pygame Info
Pygame should be installed for both projects with: py -m pip install -U pygame --user
(py standing for the python equivalent used on your device, for example: python.exe)

After that both projects can be run with:
py Full_Game.py
py main.py
Please note that the audio output for the BCX project only works on Windows.

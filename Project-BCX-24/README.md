# Bosch Connected Experience 2024 Project
This project was created during the **BCX24** in Berlin, with a team called **Brightfuture**.
Aim of the project was to create an road-assistance AI for truckers, thus we named the result **"Truckie"**.

To ensure safety the open-ai keys got removed during upload. Just create your own and insert them for testing/usage.
